List of Initial Classes: Employee, Room, Building, Event, Schedule, RoomManager, Grid


Abstract class Employee / could also be an interface

Employee fields:
-	priority (Enum) (Higher priority employees could override reservations made by lower priority emps);
-	title;
-	location; (So that distances could be calculated between the employee building and other buildings. Some coordinate system would thus be needed).

Employee class could be inherited by classes Intern, Manager -> Unit manager,DepartmentHead. Add polymorphism here.


Abstract class Room / could also be an interface

Room fields:
-	roomType (conference, etc, Enum);
-	capacity;
-	multimediaType and availability; //some inheritance here, perhaps //pattern COMPOSITE
-	availableTimeSlots/occupiedTimeSlots.
This class could be inherited by other room types, maybe?


Class Building:

Fields:
-	location;
-	rentPriceCategory. ??


Class Event:

Fields:
-	priority;
-	size (in terms of people);
-	timeslot;

Class Grid:
This class represents a 2D coordinate system that keeps track of buildings and calculates distances between them. Or, each building could keep its coordinates as fields.
